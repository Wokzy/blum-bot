### Will I be banned for using this script?
---
 - In contrast to other bots, My script is interacting with user interface, NOT with Blum api, and does casual left button mouse clicks on "stars".
 - I CANNOT guarantee anything about punishments from Blum development team, because Im not a developer of blum
 - The only thing that I can guarantee is that My script is programmatically untraceable, which means Blum developers cannot definitely distinguish my script from a casual human user.
